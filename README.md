# Tips Data Analysis Project

This project demonstrates a complete data analysis workflow using the **Tips** dataset. It covers every stage—from loading the Excel file to generating visualizations—while transforming raw, unstructured data into meaningful insights.

---

## 📌 Overview

Key objectives of this project:
- Import the dataset from an Excel file
- View and explore the data structure
- Apply selection, filtering, and conditional operations
- Handle missing values and perform aggregation
- Create insightful visualizations and dashboards

---

## 🛠️ Tools and Libraries

- **Python**
- **Pandas** – data manipulation and analysis
- **NumPy** – numerical operations
- **Matplotlib** – plotting and charting
- **Seaborn** – statistical data visualization

---

## 📊 Key Steps in the Analysis

1. **Data Import**
   - Loaded `tips.xlsx` using `pandas.read_excel()`

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Inspected data using `.head()`, `.info()`, `.describe()`
   - Selected columns and filtered rows
   - Applied conditions to extract specific subsets

3. **Data Cleaning**
   - Identified and handled missing values
   - Verified and adjusted data types if needed

4. **Aggregation and Grouping**
   - Used `groupby()`, `mean()`, `sum()` for summarized insights
   - Analyzed tips by day, gender, time, and smoker status

5. **Data Visualization**
   - Created:
     - **Bar plots** for average tips
     - **Box plots** to visualize tip distribution
     - **Scatter plots** to explore relationships
   - Built simple dashboards for visual storytelling

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset (`tips.xlsx`) contains information on:
- `total_bill`: Total bill amount
- `tip`: Tip given
- `sex`: Gender of the customer
- `smoker`: Whether the customer smokes
- `day`: Day of the week
- `time`: Lunch or Dinner
- `size`: Party size

## 📷 Example Visuals

- Average Tip by Day  
- Tip Distribution by Gender  
- Tip vs Total Bill Scatter Plot (colored by gender and smoker status)
